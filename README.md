# SCMPolicies
This is a repository to gather a set of translation examples from the Security Capability Manager (SCM), a framework for automated security policy enforcement.

The structure of the repository contains:
* a folder with a set of sub-directories consisting of examples of policies translated by the SCM
    * Each of these sub-directories contains two files: an _Abstract\_Policy_ XML file, containing the abstract policy provided to the SCM for translation, and a _Low\_Level\_Policy_ text file, containing the policy translated for the folder SC
* a folder containing the strongSwan policies used to validate the translation process of channel protection configurations
* a snapshot of the formal model section related to channel protection, known as Capability Model - Channel Protection (CM-CP) 

Future updates and additions will be documented into this README file.
