# SCMPolicies
This is a repository to gather a set of translation examples from the Security Capability Manager (SCM), a framework for automated security policy enforcement.

The structure of the repository is organized as follows:
* The main directory contains a series of sub-directories, one for each Security Control (SC) supported by the framework
* Each of these sub-directories contains two files: an _Abstract\_Policy_ XML file, containing the abstract policy provided to the SCM for translation, and a _Low\_Level\_Policy_ text file, containing the policy translated for the folder SC.

Future updates and additions will be documented into this README file.
